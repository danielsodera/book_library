#Interface goal 
# Welcome to your Book Tracker ðŸ“–

# 1. View all books
# 2. Add a new book
# 3. Filter by status
# 4. Update a book
# 5. Delete a book
# 6. Exit

# Choose an option: 2

# Enter title: The Hobbit
# Enter author: J.R.R. Tolkien
# Enter status (read / reading / to-read): to-read

# Book added successfully!

#current progress 
#day 1 
#added a Library class, initalized a library array to hold all book data 
#defined a readCsv method that succesfully adds the CSV content to an object (array of hashes) 
#defined a start_program method to add the first inital steps of the program 
#defined method view_books, which allows you too see books 
#issue, books are currently displayed through book[0] which is the first column. We want to be able to access each individual book by name if needed.

#day 2
#changed readCSV to use a foreach that adds the headers as first row symbols 
#program now writes back (saves) a new csv file to local directory with #save_csv method
#asks user to write a name for the new csv file before saving 
#adds safety for if user writes an option outside of (1-6)
#nextsteps: Before this gets too big, move it to visual studio to commit properly and add testing for each method 
#tests for: read_csv, start_program, view_books, save_csv
